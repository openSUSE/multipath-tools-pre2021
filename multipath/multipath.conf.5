.SH NAME
multipath.conf \- multipath daemon configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "multipath.conf"
is the configuration file for the multipath daemon. It is used to
overwrite the built-in configuration table of \fBmultipathd\fP.
Any line whose first non-white-space character is a '#' is considered
a comment line. Empty lines are ignored.
.SH SYNTAX
The configuration file contains entries of the form:
.RS

.LP
Each \fIsection\fP contains one or more attributes or subsections. The
recognized keywords for attributes or subsections depend on the
section in which they occor.
.LP
The following \fIsection\fP keywords are recognized:
.TP 17
.B defaults
This section defines default values for attributes which are used
whenever no values are given in the appropriate device or multipath
sections.
.TP
.B blacklist
This section defines which devices should be excluded from the
multipath topology discovery.
.TP
.B blacklist_exceptions
This section defines which devices should be included in the
multipath topology discovery, despite being listed in the
.I blacklist
section.
.TP
.B multipaths
This section defines the multipath topologies. They are indexed by a
\fIWorld Wide Identifier\fR(wwid), which is taken to be the value of
the udev attribute given by the
\fIuid_attribute\fR keyword.
.TP
.B devices
This section defines the device-specific settings.
.RE
.LP
.SH "defaults section"
The
.B defaults
section recognizes the following keywords:
.TP 17
.B polling_interval

default verbosity. Higher values increase the verbosity level. Valid
levels are between 0 and 6; default is
.I 2

active paths.
.TP
.B manual
Do not perform automatic failback.
.TP
.B followover
Only perform automatic failback when the first path of a pathgroup
becomes active. This keeps a node from automatically failing back when
another node requested the failover.
.TP
.B values > 0
deferred failback (time to defer in seconds)
.TP
Default value is \fImanual\fR.
.RE
.TP

the same path group. This is only for BIO based multipath. Default is
.I 1000
.TP
.B rr_min_io_rq
The number of IO requests to route to a path before switching to the
next in the same path group. This is only for request based multipath.
Default is
.I 1
.TP
.B rr_weight
If set to \fIpriorities\fR the multipath configurator will assign
path weights as "path prio * rr_min_io". Possible values are
.I priorities
or
.IR uniform .
Default is
.IR uniform .
.TP
.B no_path_retry
Specify the number of retries until disable queueing, or
.I fail
for immediate failure (no queueing),
.I queue
for never stop queueing. Default is 0.
.TP
.B user_friendly_names
If set to 
.I yes
, using the bindings file
.I /etc/multipath/bindings
to assign a persistent and unique alias to the multipath, in the form of mpath<n>.
If set to 
.I no
use the WWID as the alias. In either case this be will
be overridden by any specific aliases in the \fImultipaths\fR section.
Default is
.I no
.TP
.B flush_on_last_del
If set to
.I yes
, multipathd will disable queueing when the last path to a device has been
deleted. Default is
.I no
.TP
.B max_fds
Specify the maximum number of file descriptors that can be opened by multipath
and multipathd.  This is equivalent to ulimit \-n. A value of \fImax\fR will set
this to the system limit from /proc/sys/fs/nr_open. If this is not set, the
maximum number of open fds is taken from the calling process. It is usually
1024. To be safe, this should be set to the maximum number of paths plus 32,
if that number is greated than 1024.
.TP
.B checker_timeout
Specify the timeout to user for path checkers that issue scsi commands with an
explicit timeout, in seconds; default taken from
.I /sys/block/sd<x>/device/timeout
.TP
.B fast_io_fail_tmo
Specify the number of seconds the scsi layer will wait after a problem has been
detected on a FC remote port before failing IO to devices on that remote port.
This should be smaller than dev_loss_tmo. Setting this to
.I off
will disable the timeout.
.TP
.B dev_loss_tmo
Specify the number of seconds the scsi layer will wait after a problem has
been detected on a FC remote port before removing it from the system. This
can be set to "infinity" which sets it to the max value of 2147483647
seconds, or 68 years. It will be automatically adjusted to the overall
retry interval
\fIno_path_retry\fR * \fIpolling_interval\fR
if a number of retries is given with \fIno_path_retry\fR and the
overall retry interval is longer than the specified \fIdev_loss_tmo\fR value.
The linux kernel will cap this value to \fI300\fR if \fBfast_io_fail_tmo\fR
is not set.
.TP
.B queue_without_daemon
If set to
.I no
, when multipathd stops, queueing will be turned off for all devices.
This is useful for devices that set no_path_retry.  If a machine is
shut down while all paths to a device are down, it is possible to hang waiting
for IO to return from the device after multipathd has been stopped. Without
multipathd running, access to the paths cannot be restored, and the kernel
cannot be told to stop queueing IO. Setting queue_without_daemon to
.I no
, avoids this problem. Default is
.I yes
.TP
.B bindings_file
The full pathname of the binding file to be used when the user_friendly_names option is set. Defaults to
.I /etc/multipath/bindings
.TP
.B wwids_file
The full pathname of the wwids file, which is used by multipath to keep track
of the wwids for LUNs it has created multipath devices on in the past.
Defaults to
.I /etc/multipath/wwids
.TP
.B log_checker_err
If set to
.I once
, multipathd logs the first path checker error at logging level 2. Any later
errors are logged at level 3 until the device is restored. If set to
.I always
, multipathd always logs the path checker error at logging level 2. Default is
.I always
.TP
.B reservation_key
This is the service action reservation key used by mpathpersist.  It must be
set for all multipath devices using persistent reservations, and it must be
the same as the RESERVATION KEY field of the PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT parameter
list which contains an 8-byte value provided by the application client to the
device server to identify the I_T nexus. It is unset by default.
.TP
.B retain_attached_hw_handler
If set to
.I yes
and the scsi layer has already attached a hardware_handler to the device,
multipath will not force the device to use the hardware_handler specified by
mutipath.conf. If the scsi layer has not attached a hardware handler,
multipath will continue to use its configured hardware handler. Default is
.I no
.TP
.B detect_prio
If set to
.I yes
, multipath will try to detect if the device supports ALUA. If so, the device
will automatically use the
.I alua
prioritizer. If not, the prioritizer will be selected as usual. Default is
.I no
.

.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
The usage of
.B queue_if_no_path
option can lead to
.B D state
processes being hung and not killable in situations where all the paths to the LUN go offline.
It is advisable to use the
.B no_path_retry
option instead.
.P
The use of
.B queue_if_no_path
or
.B no_path_retry
might lead to a deadlock if the
.B dev_loss_tmo
setting results in a device being removed while I/O is still queued.
The multipath daemon will update the
.B dev_loss_tmo
setting accordingly to avoid this deadlock. Hence if both values are
specified the order of precedence is
.I no_path_retry, queue_if_no_path, dev_loss_tmo
